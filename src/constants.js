export const DB_NAME = "videotube";
// this is simply a database name , instead of writing it in .env here we are writing , it is nothing like here only we can do this it is simple a variable that have a value that's it.

// Here we store fixed values like database name , roles like USER : "user", ADMIN : "ADMIN"
// Why we store here because it is also separation of concern , while using fixed values inside our project it distubrs code flow , for this we write hardcoded values inside constant.js
